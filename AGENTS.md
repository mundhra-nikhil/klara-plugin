# docmancer

Docmancer compresses documentation context so coding agents spend tokens on code, not on rereading raw docs. It ingests local files, fetches public docs, indexes everything locally with SQLite FTS5, and returns compact context packs with source attribution.

Executable: `& 'C:\Users\Int202613\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts\docmancer.exe' --config 'C:\Users\Int202613\.docmancer\docmancer.yaml'`

**Important PowerShell Execution Requirement:** Because the executable path is provided as a quoted string, **you must use the PowerShell call operator (`&`)** to execute it (as shown above). If you omit the `&`, PowerShell will treat it as a string and fail with an error like `Unexpected token 'config'`.

**All commands below use `docmancer` as shorthand for the full executable path above.**

Use docmancer when the user asks about library docs, API references, vendor docs, version-specific behavior, offline docs, or wants to add docs before answering a technical question.

## Workflow

1. Run `docmancer list` to see indexed docs.
2. Run `docmancer query "question"` when relevant docs are present.
3. If local docs are missing and the user approves the path, run `docmancer ingest <path>`.
4. If URL docs are missing and the user approves the source, run `docmancer add <url>`.
5. Use the returned sections as source-grounded context for the answer or code change.

## Core Commands

```bash
docmancer setup
docmancer ingest ./docs
docmancer add https://docs.example.com
docmancer update
docmancer query "how to authenticate"
docmancer query "how to authenticate" --limit 10
docmancer query "how to authenticate" --expand
docmancer query "how to authenticate" --expand page
docmancer query "how to authenticate" --format json
docmancer query "how to authenticate" --allow-degraded
docmancer clear --dry-run
docmancer list
docmancer inspect
docmancer remove <source>
docmancer doctor
docmancer fetch <url> --output <dir>
```

`query` prints estimated raw docs tokens, context-pack tokens, percent saved, and agentic runway. Prefer the compact default. Use `--expand` for adjacent sections; use `--expand page` only when the surrounding page is necessary. Use `--allow-degraded` in dense, sparse, or hybrid modes when vector retrieval is down or misconfigured and you still need lexical results.

When documentation context is relevant, do not rely only on model memory or latest-only hosted docs. Query docmancer first, then cite or summarize the relevant local sections in the response.
